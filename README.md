Welcome to my Data Science Internship Projects repository! This repository contains various data analysis and machine learning projects that I completed during my internship at Oasis Infobyte. Each project demonstrates different aspects of data science, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, model building, and evaluation.

Projects Included
Unemployment Analysis in India

Analyzing unemployment trends and the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment rates in India.

Visualizing state-wise and region-wise unemployment rates and labor participation rates.

Car Price Prediction

Predicting car selling prices using advanced data analysis techniques and deep learning models.

Feature engineering, data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

Advertising Sales Prediction

Predicting sales based on advertising data using various machine learning models.

Hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and visualization.
